# StyleStar-Unity
 
 
### Some Notes

This was developed using Unity version 2018.4.15f1, it can currently be used with Unity 2018.04.20f1 without issue. 
The build is not currently compatible with later editions of Unity, but there will be upgrade relatively soon.
StyleStar is also only compatible on Windows, but we hope to change this in the future as well.


### Project Setup

1. After cloning this repository, open the project folder `StyleStar-Unity` upon loading Unity.
2. Upon opening the StyleStar-Unity project, open the SongSelection scene, located in `Assets/Scenes`.
3. At this point, press the play button in Unity to start the game. You can debug from this point on with your favorite IDE.

NOTE: It's possible for text to not show in the game. This is because all text fields are blank in the project and you have to set them manually. This will be fixed. 

 
### Unzip font asset file!

In `Assets/Fonts`, unzip `librefranklin-mplus SDF.zip` right to the same folder, so the `*.asset` file is here.
